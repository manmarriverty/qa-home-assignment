# Unit tests

For a given project unit testing is required for this classes:
- CardValidation.Core/Services/CardValidationService.cs - full cover with unit tests
- CardValidation.Web/Infrustructure/CreditCardValidationFilter.cs - only behavior of filter
- CardValidation.Web/Controllers/CardValidationController.cs - only behavior of controller

Files not to be tested via unit tests:
- CardValidation.Core/Enums/PaymentSystemType.cs - no logic
- CardValidation.Web/ViewModels/CreditCard.cs - no logic
- CardValidation.Web/Program.cs - bad practice to test Program.cs, no use

Achieved coverage is 91% for given project, which is above the 80% requirement.
Most of missing coverage comes from Program.cs, which is not a subject to unit testing.

# Integration testing

Integration testing done with ReqnRoll framework and xUnit (chosen since CardValidation.Tests.Unit already uses it).

There is one smoke test, which defines a valid path with next card data:
- Owner: John Doe
- Number: 4242424242424242
- Date: validDate (current month + 2 months)
- CVC: 111

If at any point this test fails, most of integration test suite is likely to fail.

# Found issues

## CardValidationService.cs

### ValidateIssueDate method in CardValidationService.cs

- Method seems to be checking for the **expiry** or **valid thru** date, but method is called ValidateIssueDate which suggests it validates the **issue** date.
I would suggest renaming the method to `ValidateExpiryDate`, `ValidateValidThruDate` or similar to avoid confusion.

- **CRITICAL!** In case the above statement is correct, below is the most important thing - most likely a **bug** and to be **urgently reported to development team!**
```csharp
var issueDateTime = new DateTime(year / 1000 > 0 ? year : 2000 + year, month, 1);
return DateTime.UtcNow < issueDateTime;
```
Possible fix:
```csharp
var expiryDate = new DateTime(year / 1000 > 0 ? year : 2000 + year, month, 1).AddMonths(1);
return DateTime.UtcNow < expiryDate;
```
We are checking against a first day of a month for expiry date, but it should be the first day of the next month.
Cards usually have "valid thru" date, which means the card is valid until the end of the month, not the beginning.
*For example, if it says 12/26, the debit card will expire on the last day of December 2026 (i.e., December 31st, 2026).* (https://fi.money/guides/debit-cards/debit-card-expiry-reasons-for-expiry-renewal-process-online).
Test `ValidateIssueDate_CurrentMonth_ReturnsTrue` is currently skipped, but must be enabled if a bug is actually present after the fix is applied.

Also worth mentioning that valid thru date is not connected to UTC time or basically any timezone, it is a expiry date and can differ based on issuing country or institution.
So a person making a transaction in last hours of his card's validity may encounter an issue with current validation logic. I advice talking with business analytics regarding this issue and maybe adjust the code.
Maybe add an error to client if trying to make a transaction on last day of card's validity, or try to let the transaction go through, and if it fails, return an error to client.

- Should be careful if YY format is still supported after year 2100, code will break (very similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem)
Problem comes from `2000 + year` part in this line:
```csharp
var issueDateTime = new DateTime(year / 1000 > 0 ? year : 2000 + year, month, 1);
```

- If possible, ask the development team to use IDateTimeProvider abstraction to allow injecting needed datetime in tests (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices
*Handle stub static references with seams* section)
This will help with tests connected to date validation as currently date calculation logic is handled on a test side, which is not considered a best practice:
```csharp
var nextMonth = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMonths(1).ToString("MM\\/yyyy");
```
Overall, nice to have, but not critical. Also in case IDateTimeProvider is added, could use `[Theory]` instead of `[Fact]` for this method tests to cover more cases via single test description.


### ValidateOwner method in CardValidationService.cs

- Validation has inconsistency regarding trailing spaces, because from this part `+ ?` in a pattern a single trailing space is allowed
```csharp
^((?:[A-Za-z]+ ?){1,3})$
```
However the single/multiple leading space or multiple trailing spaces are not allowed. Probably not a major issue, but might be worth discussing with the team.

### ValidateNumber method in CardValidationService.cs

- All validation checks (against Visa, Mastercard and American Express) are for regex format only, should consider adding a check for Luhn validity on backend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm.
This would lower the load on card processing service, and limit the amount of incorrect card validations.

## Misc

- Typo in Infrustructure folder name, should be Infrastructure.

# Running tests locally

- Unit tests can be run separately via `dotnet test CardValidation.Tests.Unit/CardValidation.Tests.Unit.csproj` command or via your IDE
- Integration tests require application to run on your machine on port 5135 via current setup. Alternative is to set WEBAPP_URL environment variable if tested against remote machine
- After that tests can be run separately via `dotnet test CardValidation.Tests.Integration/CardValidation.Tests.Integration.csproj` command or via your IDE

# Running tests via Docker

- To run tests via Docker, you need to have Docker installed and running on your machine
- You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to run the tests in a containerized environment
- To run the tests, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
docker compose run --rm unit-tests
```
```bash
docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit integration-tests web
```
- After you run tests, the results will be available in the `TestResults` directory in the corresponding project

# Home Assignment

You will be required to write unit tests and automated tests for a payment application to demonstrate your skills. 

# Application information 

Itâ€™s an small microservice that validates provided Credit Card data and returns either an error or type of credit card application. 

# API Requirements 

API that validates credit card data. 

Input parameters: Card owner, Credit Card number, issue date and CVC. 

Logic should verify that all fields are provided, card owner does not have credit card information, credit card is not expired, number is valid for specified credit card type, CVC is valid for specified credit card type. 

API should return credit card type in case of success: Master Card, Visa or American Express. 

API should return all validation errors in case of failure. 


# Technical Requirements 

 - Write unit tests that covers 80% of application 
 - Write integration tests (preferably using Reqnroll framework) 
 - As a bonus: 
    - Create a pipeline where unit tests and integration tests are running with help of Docker. 
    - Produce tests execution results. 

# Running the  application 

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository on your local machine 
3. Compile and Run application Visual Studio 2022.
